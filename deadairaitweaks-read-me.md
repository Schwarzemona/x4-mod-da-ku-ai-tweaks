- interrupt.attacked script - AllowMilitaryFlee - Military ships will be allowed to flee if they are reduced to below than 75% of hull percentage + shield percentage. If the ship has an attack order, it will not flee if it thinks it can destroy it's target before dying.</t>
- interrupt.attacked script - DecideToFight - Adjusts retaliation calculations. Stops xenon economy ships from always fighting.</t>

- move.seekenemies script - DistressCallResponse - Police and patrols will respond more reliably to distress calls in their sector (Yes, patrol ships will actually respond unlike vanilla). This also implements support for ships mimic'ing the patrol/police order.</t>

- order.mining.routine script - RespectMaxRange - Removes the tripling of maxrange applied to player owned ships with 5 star pilot.</t>

- trade.find.free script - BetterBuyOfferFiltering - Filters buy offers from stations the ship would actually be able to sell to.</t>
- trade.find.free script - ImprovedBuildStoragePrioritization - Adjusts the NPC ship filtering so that it actually works but restricts the trades to small and medium ships. This also fixes a bug where player ships would ignore the minimum volume so you shouldn't see large ships with 27 energy cells.</t>

- factiongoal_invade_space - AllowMoreOrdering - Allows a faction to order up to half the desired ships for an invasion instead of one quarter. This should prevent some invasions from not gathering enough strength.</t>
- factiongoal_invade_space - AllowOrderingForExpedition - Allows a faction that performs expeditions to order ships instead of just using whatever is available at the time.</t>
- job_helper - BuildAtClosestOnly - Adds logic that ensures ships are only ordered at closest shipyard to their job location. This will help prevent the wandering Xenon job ships being ordered across the galaxy from where they are meant to be. Does not affect chance of selecting player shipyards.</t>
