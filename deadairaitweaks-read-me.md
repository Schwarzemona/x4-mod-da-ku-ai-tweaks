- Implemented options menu for DA tweaks.
- move.generic script - ObjectChangedSector - Ships will recalculate when the object they are moving to an object and it changes sectors.
- move.generic script - ForceTravel - Ships will be forced to use travel drive in some instances they would slowboat instead.
- move.generic script - SmallerRadius - Ships will attempt to get closer to their destination point instead of within 10km of it. (Unless they are really really big)

- interrupt.attacked script - AllowMilitaryFlee - Military ships will be allowed to flee if they are reduced to below than 75% of hull percentage + shield percentage. If the ship has an attack order, it will not flee if it thinks it can destroy it's target before dying.
- interrupt.attacked script - DecideToFight - Adjusts retaliation calculations. Stops xenon economy ships from always fighting.
- interrupt.attacked script - AllowCivilianFight - Civilian ships will be allowed to retaliate if they are currently waiting for orders and they think they can destroy their target before dying.

- interrupt.attacked script - Civilian Flee HP Percent - Changes HP percentage of {1111920,5031}.
- interrupt.attacked script - Military Flee HP Percent - Changes HP percentage of {1111920,5032}.
- lib.calculate.miningefficiency script - SectorWideProbe - A resource probe anywhere in the sector will provide benefits.
- lib.respond.inspected script - ComplyWhenLawAbiding - Ships without a set response to being inspected will comply when they have nothing to fear from police.
- move.collect.ship.smallship script - UseTravelMore - Small ships collecting drops will use their travel drive more for objects further than 5km away.
- move.collect.ship.smallship script - UseMagnet - Small ships collecting drops will use an instant container magnet for wares within 5km.
- move.seekenemies script - PoliceResponse - Police will respond more reliably to trouble calls in their sector. This also implements support for ships mimic'ing the police order.
- move.seekenemies script - DistressCallResponse - Police and patrols will respond more reliably to distress calls in their sector (Yes, patrol ships will actually respond unlike vanilla). This also implements support for ships mimic'ing the patrol/police order.
- move.seekenemies script - RemoveResponseSkillCheck - Removes the skill check for ships responding to trouble or distress calls further than their radar coverage.

- order.build.deploy script - StopLosingDrones - Fixes bug where ships that move to new task after waiting more than an hour for resources at build storage leave their drones behind.
- order.build.find.task script - BuildAIStations - Allows player owned building ships to be hired by NPC factions and will respect travel/activity blacklists.
- order.mining.routine script - RespectMaxRange - Removes the tripling of maxrange applied to player owned ships with 5 star pilot.
- order.mining.routine script - CheckForDemand - Ships that are set to order multiple wares will always check for demand to determine which ware to gather.
- order.mining.routine script - CheckActualDemand - Ships that check demand will check stations that they would actually be able to sell at.
- order.mining.routine script - DropUnsellable - Player owned ships that have unsellable cargo due to lack of demand will drop the wares just like the NPC mining ships do.
- order.move.recon script - LongerLegalScans - Police ships that are scanning law abiding ships can do so from a longer range.

- trade.find.free script - BetterBuyOfferFiltering - Filters buy offers from stations the ship would actually be able to sell to.
- trade.find.free script - ImprovedBuildStoragePrioritization - Adjusts the NPC ship filtering so that it actually works but restricts the trades to small and medium ships. This also fixes a bug where player ships would ignore the minimum volume so you shouldn't see large ships with 27 energy cells.
- trade.station script - StopIgnoringReservations - Stops stations from ignoring reservations for wares that it wants to send to it's build storage. This fixes a lot of failed trades where the ship arrives to a station that no longer has the wares for it.

- factiongoal_invade_space - AllowMoreOrdering - Allows a faction to order up to half the desired ships for an invasion instead of one quarter. This should prevent some invasions from not gathering enough strength.
- factiongoal_invade_space - AllowOrderingForExpedition - Allows a faction that performs expeditions to order ships instead of just using whatever is available at the time.
- job_helper - BuildAtClosestOnly - Adds logic that ensures ships are only ordered at closest shipyard to their job location. This will help prevent the wandering Xenon job ships being ordered across the galaxy from where they are meant to be. Does not affect chance of selecting player shipyards.
- job_helper - HigherDistanceScaling - Increases the likelyhood that ships will be ordered at the closest shipyard to their job location. This diminishes the affect of high prices but would potentially result in player shipyard being selected less.
- notifications - IncreasedBountyRange - Adds search for stations further than radar range when checking if player should receive a bounty for enemy kill.
