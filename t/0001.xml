		<t id="6011">move.generic script - Ships will recalculate when the object they are moving to an object and it changes sectors.</t>
		<t id="6012">move.generic script - Ships will be forced to use travel drive in some instances they would slowboat instead.</t>
		<t id="6013">move.generic script - Ships will attempt to get closer to their destination point instead of within 10km of it. (Unless they are really really big)</t>
		<t id="6021">engineer.ai script - Objects that can repair themselves are no longer skill limited and will repair to 100%, eventually.</t>
		<t id="6022">engineer.ai script - Objects that can repair themselves will keep the drones internal and calculations are adjusted for total number of repair drones, not drones that have been launched.</t>
		<t id="6031">interrupt.attacked script - Adjusts flee calculations. Civilian ships will flee when they are reduced to less than 150% of hull percentage + shield percentage.</t>
		<t id="6032">interrupt.attacked script - Military ships will be allowed to flee if they are reduced to below than 75% of hull percentage + shield percentage. If the ship has an attack order, it will not flee if it thinks it can destroy it's target before dying.</t>
		<t id="6033">interrupt.attacked script - Adjusts retaliation calculations. Stops xenon economy ships from always fighting.</t>
		<t id="6034">interrupt.attacked script - Civilian ships will be allowed to retaliate if they are currently waiting for orders and they think they can destroy their target before dying.</t>
		<t id="6035">interrupt.attacked script - Ships will not call for help if the police have a better relationship with the attacker.</t>
		<t id="6036">interrupt.attacked script - Changes HP percentage of {1111920,5031}.</t>
		<t id="6036">interrupt.attacked script - Changes HP percentage of {1111920,5032}.</t>
		<t id="6041">lib.calculate.miningefficiency script - A resource probe anywhere in the sector will provide benefits.</t>
		<t id="6051">lib.respond.inspected script - Ships without a set response to being inspected will comply when they have nothing to fear from police.</t>
		<t id="6061">move.collect.ship.smallship script - Small ships collecting drops will use their travel drive more for objects further than 5km away.</t>
		<t id="6062">move.collect.ship.smallship script - Small ships collecting drops will use an instant container magnet for wares within 5km.</t>
		<t id="6071">move.seekenemies script - Police will respond more reliably to trouble calls in their sector. This also implements support for ships mimic'ing the police order.</t>
		<t id="6072">move.seekenemies script - Police and patrols will respond more reliably to distress calls in their sector (Yes, patrol ships will actually respond unlike vanilla). This also implements support for ships mimic'ing the patrol/police order.</t>
		<t id="6073">move.seekenemies script - Removes the skill check for ships responding to trouble or distress calls further than their radar coverage.</t>
		<t id="6081">order.build.deploy script - Sets up payment scale for player owned building ships. Ships earn 1,000,000 Cr per hour of work with a minimum of 500,000 Cr.</t>
		<t id="6082">order.build.deploy script - Fixes bug where ships that move to new task after waiting more than an hour for resources at build storage leave their drones behind.</t>
		<t id="6091">order.build.find.task script - Allows player owned building ships to be hired by NPC factions and will respect travel/activity blacklists.</t>
		<t id="6101">order.mining.routine script - Removes the tripling of maxrange applied to player owned ships with 5 star pilot.</t>
		<t id="6102">order.mining.routine script - Ships that are set to order multiple wares will always check for demand to determine which ware to gather.</t>
		<t id="6103">order.mining.routine script - Ships that check demand will check stations that they would actually be able to sell at.</t>
		<t id="6104">order.mining.routine script - Player owned ships that have unsellable cargo due to lack of demand will drop the wares just like the NPC mining ships do.</t>
		<t id="6111">order.move.recon script - Police ships that are scanning law abiding ships can do so from a longer range.</t>
		<t id="6112">order.move.recon script - Police ships that are moving to scan a ship will attempt to move to where the target is going instead of just constantly moving to where the ship was when the move started.</t>
		<t id="6113">order.move.recon script - Police ships will complete scans much faster than vanilla.</t>
		<t id="6114">order.move.recon script - Should prevent/reduce police going hostile for seemingly no reason.</t>
		<t id="6121">trade.find.free script - Filters sell offers from stations the ship would actually be able to buy from.</t>
		<t id="6122">trade.find.free script - Filters buy offers from stations the ship would actually be able to sell to.</t>
		<t id="6123">trade.find.free script - Adjusts the NPC ship filtering so that it actually works but restricts the trades to small and medium ships. This also fixes a bug where player ships would ignore the minimum volume so you shouldn't see large ships with 27 energy cells.</t>
		<t id="6131">trade.station script - Stops stations from ignoring reservations for wares that it wants to send to it's build storage. This fixes a lot of failed trades where the ship arrives to a station that no longer has the wares for it.</t>
		<t id="6132">trade.station script - Stops stations from breaking trades with the extremely slow and buggy calculations/methods used to transfer wares to it's build storage. If a station has the wares at the interval, it will actually send wares to build storage.</t>
